  This  document  contains  a  sketchy  description  of OPS5 language features,
syntax and semantics of conditions and actions.  For more information,  consult
the OPS5 manual.

1 Production Memory
  create rules with p (production) or build (later)

  an OPS5 production-rule definition is a list containing

   - a function call to p

   - LHS  =  one  or  more condition elements (first not negated), each in
     Lisp list format.

   - a separator = -->

   - RHS = one or more actions, each in Lisp list format.

2 Sample Rule
;; IF    the key is on AND the engine is not turning
;; THEN  conclude that the problem is in the starting system
(p bad-starting-system
    (task ^goal diagnose)
    (fact ^name |key is off| ^value no)
    (fact ^name |engine is turning| ^value no)
    -->
    (bind <x> |problem is in starting system|)
    (make fact ^name <x> ^value yes)
    (write (crlf) Concluding <x> (crlf)))

3 Left-Hand Side
  LHS is collection of patterns to be matched against  working  memory.    Each
pattern  contains  an  element-class name followed by some number of LHS terms.
Each term consists  of  an  ^attribute-name  followed  by  a  LHS-value.    The
LHS-value can be a

constant        in  pattern ^on couch, ``couch'' is a constant; in pattern ^GRE
                100, ``100'' is a constant;

variable        in pattern, ^Status <n1>, ``<n1>'' is  variable  that  will  be
                bound  during  matching  to an actual value for some element in
                working memory;

predicate operator
                one  of seven operators may precede a constant or variable:  =,
                <>, <=>, <, <=, >=, >; the =  is  assumed  if  no  operator  is
                present;

disjunction     in  the  pattern  ^weight << light medium >>, ``<< light medium
                >>'' specifies that only one of the set of  values,  light  and
                medium,  must  match;  any  LHS-values  may be contained in the
                disjunction; warning leave  spaces  between  values  and  angle
                brackets to avoid confusing them with variable brackets;

conjunction     in  pattern ^GRE { > 600 < 800 }, ``{ > 600 < 800 }'' specifies
                a set of value  restrictions  all  of  which  must  match;  any
                LHS-values may be contained in the conjunction;

  Restrictions to predicate operators:

   - <,  <=,  >=  and > used only with numbers and with variables bound to
     numbers.  <=> means same type, and <> means not equal.

   - first occurrence of a variable cannot be preceded  by  any  predicate
     other than = (first occurrence establishes binding)

  A  condition  pattern  in  LHS (other than first) may be negated by putting a
``-'' in front of the normal pattern

  Ordering of condition  elements  is  significant  in  variable  binding,  for
conflict resolution and for match efficiency

4 RHS of OPS5 Rules

   - The RHS of the OPS5 rule consists of an ordered sequence of actions.

   - The  primitive  actions  that affect working memory are make, modify,
     and remove.

   - The write action is used to output information.

   - The halt action provides a way of explicitly stopping the  firing  of
     production rules.

   - RHS can also contain functions that return values within the actions.
     For example, the compute function allows OPS5 to do arithmetic.    It
     provides  for  infix  evaluation  of  +,-,*, //, and \\ (respectively
     addition,  subtraction,  multiplication,  division,   and   modulus).
     Operations are performed from right to left.

   - These  and  other  actions  and  functions  will  be  demonstrated by
     example.

5 Specific Commands

                               The WATCH Command

no argument     Print current watch level (initialized to 1) unchanged

(watch 0)       No report of firings or changes to working memory

(watch 1)       Report rule name and time tags of each working  memory  element
                for each instantiation fired

(watch 2)       In  addition  to  level  1  reports,  give  each change (add or
                delete) to working memory

                                The RUN Command

(run)           run until a break or halt or no rules in conflict set

(run N)         run N steps unless early stop as above

(run 1)         for single stepping

                           [The WM and PPWM Commands

  (wm) -- list the contents of working memory, optional arguments specify  time
tags; if no time tags are given, shows all elements.

  (ppwm  <pat>)  --  <pat> is pattern (in LHS condition form), prints all wme's
that match <pat>.  No variables, predicates or special characters  are  allowed
in in <pat>.  If pattern is null, all elements are printed.

  use  with cs and matches to determine why a rule failed to be instantiated at
the right time.

                                The PM Command

  (pm <args>) -- <args> any number of rule names

                                The CS Command

  (cs) -- lists each instantiated rule in conflict set, one to a line, followed
by  currently  dominant  instantiation  (that  is,  the one to be fired on next
cycle)

                              The MATCHES Command

  (matches <rules>) --  prints  partial  matches  for  rules  whose  names  are
arguments.    For  each  condition  element  of  specified  rules, time tags of
matching wme's are listed, as well as intersections of partial matches.

        (literalize number value)

        (p example-rule
           (number ^value { <number-1> > 100 } )
           (number ^value { <number-2> <> <number-1> } )
           (number ^value { <number-3> < 50 } )
           -->
           (write (crlf) <number-1> <number-2> <number-3> ) )

        (make number ^value 101)  ; given time-tag 1

        (make number ^value 102)  ; given time-tag 2

        (make number ^value  11)  ; given time-tag 3
        =>(matches example-rule)

        example-rule
         ** matches for (1) **
         2
         1
         ** matches for (2) **
         3
         2
         1
         ** matches for (2 1) **
         3  1
         3  2
         1  2
         2  1
         ** matches for (3)
         3
        nil
The final intersection, which in this example would be matches for (3 2 1),  is
not included.

  Uses:

   - a given condition element is never matched,

   - the  intersection of two or more condition elements, each of which is
     matched, fails to be satisfied, or

   - a negated condition element is matched.

                              The PBREAK Command

   - (pbreak <rules>) -- toggles break/nobreak status of rules

   - (pbreak) -- says which rules are broken

   - breaks after rule fires
                               The BACK Command

   - (back <n>) undoes the effects of up  to  32  rule  firings,  provided
     there are no external references (user-defined functions) in any RHS

                         The MAKE and REMOVE Commands

   - (remove *) deletes everything from working memory.

   - (remove  <args>)  deletes  working  memory elements with time tags in
     <args>

                              The EXCISE Command

  (excise <rules>) -- prevents rules from firing (still in network), reload  to
recall, but won't be current on wm.
